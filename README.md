    Defeat the Ender Dragon: The primary goal for most Minecraft speedruns. Players need to collect resources, locate a Stronghold, activate the End Portal, and defeat the Ender Dragon as quickly as possible.

    Acquire Full Diamond Armor: Collect enough diamonds to craft a full set of diamond armor. This involves mining, possibly trading, and efficient resource management.

    Build a Nether Portal: Create and light a Nether Portal to enter the Nether dimension. This requires gathering obsidian or using lava and water buckets efficiently to form the portal frame.

    Obtain Elytra: Travel to an End City after defeating the Ender Dragon to find and acquire the Elytra, which allows players to glide. This involves navigating through the End and potentially fighting Shulkers.

    Craft a Beacon: Collect the necessary materials to craft a beacon and power it up. This involves killing the Wither to obtain a Nether Star, which requires collecting Wither Skeleton skulls and soul sand, then building and defeating the Wither boss.
